This repository provides the dataset generated and analyzed in the article entitled "Designing Ti-6Al-4V microstructure for strain delocalization using neural networks"

More info coming soon. The microstructure and strain files are more than 100 MB each and GitHub does not allow to upload such large files. Dataset will be uploaded soon in a more compact version. Please stay tuned...
