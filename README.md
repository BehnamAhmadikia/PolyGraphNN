# PolyGraphNN
This repository provides the dataset generated and analyzed in the article entitled "Designing Ti-6Al-4V microstructure for strain delocalization using neural networks"

Strain files have been uploaded to the appropriate folder. The name of each file indicates the corresponding polycrystal. For instance, "strain-B-8-14.3-0.1.vtk" contains the strain along the loading direction for a polycrystal sampled from Texture B, with a grain aspect ratio (AR) of 8, average grain size (ESD_ave) of 14.3 voxels,  and standard deviation for the log-normal distribution of grain size equals to 0.1. 

Microstructure files are very large files and violate the GitHub storage limit. These files will be uploaded soon in a more compact version. Please stay tuned...
